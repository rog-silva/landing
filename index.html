        <h2>1. Torres Del Paine National Park</h2>
        <p>One of Chile's most important natural areas and an increasingly popular travel destination is the spectacular
          Torres del Paine National Park. Situated more than 100 kilometers north of the city of Puerto Natales in southern
          Patagonia, this stunningly beautiful area encompasses mountains, glaciers, and countless lakes and rivers.</p>
        <p>One of the top guided tours of the park is the five-day W Trek, one of the top hikes in Patagonia.
          This 71-kilometer route takes in some of the top points of interest in Patagonia, including the massive Glacier
          Grey and the mountains of Paine Grande.</p>

        <h2>2. Valle de la Luna and the Atacama Desert</h2>
        <p>Valle de la Luna, which literally translates as "Valley of the Moon," lies 13 kilometers west of San Pedro de
          Atacama at the north end of the country, near its border with Bolivia. It can be accessed via well-marked bike
          trails, tour buses, or self-drive car rentals.</p>
        <p>Other notable features of the Atacama Desert are the region's many caverns, some containing evidence of pictographs
          created by early man and where some of the world's oldest mummies, preserved by the area's aridity, were found.
          The most famous of these, the Chinchorro mummies, are now on display at the archaeological museum in San Miguel
          de Azapa.</p>

        <h2>3. Easter Island & Rapa Nui National Park</h2>
        <p>First visited by Europeans in 1722, the magnificent yet remote Easter Island – so named by a Dutch Explorer
          who first set eyes on it on Easter Sunday – has been inhabited for thousands of years by Polynesians.
          Despite being more than 3,500 kilometers away from mainland Chile, this fascinating island with its remarkable
          stone sculptures remains the country's most recognizable attraction.</p>
        <p>All told, 887 of these statues, known as Moai – created by the island's early Rapa Nui population – have
          been identified, most of them now protected by Rapa Nui National Park (the island itself has been declared a
          UNESCO World Heritage Site). The most impressive collection is at Ahu Tongariki where 15 of them have been
          re-erected on the island's largest Moai platform, or "ahu."</p>
